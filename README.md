# ladder-breaker

An app for improving you Go reading skills!

## How does this work?

> Ladders should be the school that teaches you to read patiently, move by move - black, white, black, white, black, white - which is the only way.
> 
> **Toshiro Kageyama - Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go**

In his book, Kageyama suggests the reader should practice reading a difficult ladder position, stone by stone, in order to improve his reading. This app will help you do just that!

It will create random positions with a ladder for you to try and read out.

After you've read the ladder and think you know the answer, click "Show Variations" to view the list of variations the app calculated for the ladder in this specific position, and try to find the position you read.
